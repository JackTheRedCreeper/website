title: Small python image and video scripts that may be useful for you too
tags: Release

I already dabbled a bit in Python before, and I know that one of its biggest strengths is how universal it is, so I made a bunch of scripts to help me with automating some annoying tasks:

The first two are a image-to-png conversor (useful for those pesky .webms that the internet likes to make us download), and a image resizer script. I use the second one to process images for videogames.
The resizer also doubles as a conversor, it will convert all non-gif pictures to .png. Both scripts are pretty similar, the main difference being that the resizer, well, resizes pictures.

The next three are Youtube related: One lets you download videos from a URL, another one lets you download entire playlists, and the third one extracts the audio track. I trust you have the rights to do these legally, of course. Wouldn't want to be doing illicit things now would you?

All scripts have comments inside them to highlight some quirks, and to make them easier to understand and edit.

You can find the scripts here:

As always, thank you for reading!
