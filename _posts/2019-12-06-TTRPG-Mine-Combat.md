In the Play-By-Post Starfinder game I'm running, the party has headed into a mine that is under attack by pirates. They have received word of a cave-in, and the miners can't help because of the hostile pirates.

<label>There are some points to think about and go through first:</label>
<ol>
  <li>What do we want to happen: Players engage pirates, THEN rescue miners. Not the players joining the pirates or similar things.</li>
  <li>We need to determine the players' priorities. Some players may think that the pirates are second priority to saving the miners, and might not engage into the fight we want them to, leading to weird decision making.</li>
  <li>We need to determine the enemies' motivations and priorities. This mostly affects what routes the players can take: Diplomacy, Stealth, Combat, etc.</li>
</ol> 

In this case, I want the players to fight the pirates and then rescue the miners. This means that our encounter should play at a distance from the cave-in, so the players focus on the combat at hand. I do not intend on adding a time limit.

<label>Even though this is meant to be a simple fight encounter, we must check on motivations and consequences. These will also determine both sides' possible courses of action.</label>
The motivations for the pirates are purely evil, and they will not try to retreat as they can't escape the mines safely. They will fight to the death, but not stupidly.
The players' motivations are: The attaack is happening in a town they're residing at and the call of 'greater good' and adventure. Some things are better left simple.
Consequences are simple: Party wins and pirates are defeated and they head to another part of the pirate assault, or party loses and have to book it out, losing fame and resources, or even die.

<label>With this in mind, I start drawing up a sketch of the battlefield. My key thoughts for this battle are:</label>
<ul>
  <li>The pirates know that reinforcements would come. Therefore, they're prepared. With tactics. They aren't too smart and haven't thought too many steps ahead, but have a few plans on how to deal with a possible fight. They will also have placed a few traps around.</li>
  <li>The players have a battlefield advantage, to make up for their lack of knowledge of the area.</li>
  <li>The map will be mostly a corridor, with the left half littered with cover and walls for close combat, while the right half will be mostly open for long ranged combat.</li>
</ul>
With all these things in consideration, we can finally start with a map sketch. I use paint.net, but you can use anything - normal Paint, Photoshop or even a pencil!
