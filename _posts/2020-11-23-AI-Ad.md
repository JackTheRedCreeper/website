title: Coming soon? AI for Savage Worlds battles
tags: [Gamedev]
---

Months ago I worked on a simple pathfinder AI for the TTRPG Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE) that would choose a proper grid place to go to, based on risks, distance, movement speed, etc. However I didn't give it much since I tend to run Theater of the Mind (that is, no grid nor map).

However, I just realized that SWADE has very few character conditions. This gives it plenty of potential for a fully working combat AI, and even automated fights.
So, I'll work more on it! The idea of having automated battles that showcase how different conditions such as terrain, rushes, ambushes, etc, affect the battle is too enticing!
