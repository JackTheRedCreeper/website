title: Simple chatroom using node.js and sockets
tags: 
---

I've created a chatroom that uses Node.js and sockets. It logs everything to a database, which means it has higher chances of breaking-- I mean, it's logging all your messages without your consent--.
*Ahem*, the database makes sure the messages will get through, and also provides a neat list of the last 10 messages whenever you connect.

All in all, I don't have much to say about it. I was challenged by a friend and here's the result, which is more of a proof of concept than a fully fledged product. You can try it live on http://dangaiden.ddns.net/ , and the code is available at https://github.com/JackTheRedCreeper/Chatroom
