Even if I don't have much to show, I guess I should still write down what's up.

I landed a job half a year ago - around August, but I didn't write anything since I was still getting my feet wet. Couple that with us not having any proper work for about four months and the radio silence becomes deafening.
Nowadays I work at a GDPR-related area and it's been fun - database work is simple and enjoyable, and I don't have to deal with the infernal Eclipse + Java Spring + multi-layered structure software. Specially when Eclipse would randomly decide that no, your workspace won't work, so it's time to set it all up again. Sigh.
But again, I'm comfortable now. Even if they're demanding us to at least go to the office once a week. That 3-4 hour train commute kills me just by thinking about it.

On a more personal hobby side, I have been dabbling into LUA for a while now. To be precise, Starfall chips in Garry's Mod. What I have right now is mostly tests: A small shop, a *very* WIP RTS system, scavengeable materials... Building blocks, really. Sadly I have to admit that I haven't touched the Savage Worlds AI much, but there are some major core changes planned. Those should also re-spark my interest for it.

So yeah, I don't have much to show on the programming side because I already program for half a day! Apologies to everyone!

Oh, also, I have a Valve Index VR set. I want to do something with it, but I have no ideas yet.

Thank you for visiting!
