title: Dockerified chatroom using docker-compose
tags: 
---

After a 6-month hiatus due to a course, I put my newly learned knowledge to integrate my chatroom with Docker containers. This allows a very easy and fast installation, without the need of any programs other than Docker Compose.
It doesn't seem like much, but it's more than meets the eye. Also a lot of running around poorly documented bugs.

You can find the code at https://github.com/JackTheRedCreeper/Chatroom-docker. Simply follow the instructions!
