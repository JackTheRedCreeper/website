My endyear school project, R.E.A.P. is a brawler-twinstick shooter hybrid that was made as a throwback to old arcade games such as Golden Axe and Knights of the Round.

The game features two player support, a small (tiny, actually) set of weapons to choose from, and one single level. It was made to be a solid base to expand upon, rather than a 'finished' product.
Due to the prototype nature of the game, the players do not have a health bar, because it would get in the way of testing.

R.E.A.P. is all made by me, with the exception of sounds, textures and the traffic cone and police car models. Character models, animations, code and decisions taken are all mine.
