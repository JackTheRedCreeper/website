title: Truthseeker - Starfinder info bot for Discord!
tags: [Gamedev] [Programming]

Truthseeker is a simple Discord bot that aims to help Starfinder TTRPG players by quickly providing them with info on demand. The bot is made in collaboration with the admins of https://thehiddentruth.info/ (name is an inside joke, we swear!) and all the information is lifted from there.

Currently, the bot doesn't have a server to keep it permanently online, and I have left Starfinder, so work on it is halted. However, it still works, and I'll try to correct any problems that arise.

Add this bot to your server!

For those not interested in Starfinder, the bot could be adapted for other online resources, be it via web scraping or database info.

The github repo is in https://github.com/JackTheRedCreeper/Truthseeker/tree/main
