Hello and thank you for your interest! It annoys me agreeing that I haven't done a whole lot. I have touched many projects but none of them seem to come to fruition, or far enough that it would be worthy of a post. I hope I can explain what has been going on behind the scenes.

During December 2019, I was writting down a post on how to make a TTRPG combat session. From the primer to the conclusion, going through guiding the players' actions and thoughts, and most importantly, battlefield design.
However, a while after that, one of the worst things struck me: Burnout. I was tired, unmotivated, irritated.

Over the months of December and January I have pondered, and in the end, left, the TTRPG system I was using. A small pile of small annoyances that wouldn't stop growing, until it had me fighting through it just to get something basic done. So, alongside that system, many games were scrapped, and with them, the post aswell.

February has been a rickety month. Lots of job offers and travels to Barcelona, plus driving school (I got my license, woo!). I've also transitioned into a new TTRPG system; one that allows for a much more freeform type of roleplay (Savage Worlds), and I'm loving it. I hope I can soon have enough experience to start writting about it - it's a whole different system and very different to run! Much more narrative based.

So, with these 4 months of inactivity described, what is up for March? Not much. Still actively looking for a job, and still learning this new TTRPG system.
I hope that by April I'll have something fun to share - Be it a fun story, something practical, or a whole new project!

And if you have read this far - thank you very much! I hope I didn't build high hopes on you, but I do hope that you have some insight into what has happened.
