Hello and thank you for your interest!

Over these months (October to March), as usual, I have done plenty of experimentation, touched many projects and watched my fair share of videos (recently discovered Game Dev Con's youtube channel - can reccomend!), but nothing worthy of a post.

Around October and November 2019 I joined some game projects. Needless to say, they didn't flourish, due to various motives. They were called off during December.

During December 2019, I was writting down a post on how to make a TTRPG combat session. From the primer to the conclusion, going through guiding the players' actions and thoughts, and most importantly, battlefield design.
However, a while after that, one of the worst things struck me: Burnout. I was tired, unmotivated, irritated.

Over the months of December and January I have pondered, and left, the TTRPG system I was using. A small pile of small annoyances that wouldn't stop growing, until it had me fighting through it just to get something seemingly basic done. So, alongside that system, many games I was running and playing in were scrapped, and with them, the post aswell.

During January and February, I've worked on some projects: A map for Garry's Mod Zombie Survival (still WIP, once it's done i'll break it down for you all!) and a Discord bot for quick SRD reference. Pretty useful!

February has been a rickety month. Lots of job offers and travels to Barcelona, plus driving school (I got my license, woo!). I've also transitioned into a new TTRPG system; one that allows for a much more freeform type of roleplay (Savage Worlds), and I'm loving it. I hope I can soon have enough experience to start writting about it - it's a whole different world and very different to run!

So, with these months of no big results plus a busy month described, what is up for March? Not much. Still actively looking for a job, and still learning this new TTRPG system. Don't get your hopes up too much, as much as I may be working on things, it doesn't mean that they'll prompt a blog post.
I hope that by April I'll have something to share - Be it a fun story, something practical, or a whole new project!

And if you have read this far - thank you very much!
