Designed for 2019's September Ludum Dare 45 hackathon, Attack of the Red-masks is a small videogame made in collaboration with another participant (Walfalcon), aiming to make a simple, yet fully functional platformer-action game.

I worked on the design and code, while Walfalcon worked mostly on graphics and helped flesh out ideas and provide valuable feedback.
In my opinion, the project has been a success; it has a solid baseline that could be expanded further upon if we wanted to make it into a full-fledged game.

The main reason it has so few ratings is because of how Ludum Dare works: Once you submit your game, you must play other games and rate them, so people can see yours and do the same. We kinda skipped on this part since we, like many other people, participated more as an excuse to have a reliable deadline.
