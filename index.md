        <h1>Welcome to Jack's den of knowledge!</h1>
        <p>This blog seeks to record and accumulate most of my knowledge, ideas and executions, for reference, easy sharing and future retrospections. Feel free to prod around at anything! </p>
        <b>More content will soon be added - Mostly projects from the past, well documented, but also things I'm working on!</b>

        <h2>Latest addition: [Name of Link]{% post_url 2019-12-07-TTRPG-Mine-Combat %}</h2>
        <p>I create a simple, but interesting combat scenario for my Starfinder game. The main aim is providing a scenario where player tactics are encouraged, rather than just going "Attack! Attack! Attack!". Full details in the post.</p>
